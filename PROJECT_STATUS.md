# Bank Transcript Database Project Status

## Current Status: Stage 2 Completed, Planning Stage 3+

### Overview
We have successfully completed Stage 2 of the bank transcript database project, implementing a modular file management system. The project now focuses on building focused, manageable stages for database creation rather than one comprehensive processor.

## Stage 1: File Aggregation âœ… COMPLETED

### What We Built
- **Automated file monitoring** system that scans Canadian and US bank transcript folders
- **Smart file copying** that only processes new/updated files using timestamp comparison
- **Flexible pattern matching** that handles various year/quarter folder naming conventions
- **Enhanced error handling** with comprehensive logging and permanent audit trails
- **Organized output structure** with standardized YYYY/QX folder organization

### Key Features Enhanced
- **Step-by-step progress tracking** with âœ“ checkmarks for successful operations
- **Dual log system** - console output plus detailed logs written to `logs/` folder
- **Comprehensive error collection** throughout execution with try-catch blocks for each major step
- **Execution timing** and detailed statistics
- **Warning detection** for edge cases (no files found, connection issues)
- **Permanent log files** for troubleshooting and audit trails

### Current State
- **Status**: Production ready and fully functional with enhanced logging
- **Location**: `stage1-file-aggregation/transcript_aggregator.py`
- **Output**: Organized PDF files in `database_refresh/YYYY/QX/filename.pdf`
- **Logging**: Comprehensive console output with error and summary logs in `logs/` folder
- **Scheduling**: Ready for cron/task scheduler deployment

## Stage 2: File Management âœ… COMPLETED

### What We Built
**File**: `stage2-database-processing/file_management.py`

A focused file comparison and master database management system that:
- **Checks master database existence** and creates if needed
- **Compares NAS files** with master database records
- **Identifies file changes** - new, modified, and deleted files
- **Outputs organized lists** for processing pipeline stages

### Key Features
- **Comprehensive logging** matching Stage 1 enhanced standards
- **Execution timing** and detailed statistics
- **Error and warning tracking** with permanent log files
- **Ordered pipeline outputs** for subsequent stages
- **Robust error handling** with try-catch blocks for each major step

### Folder Structure Implemented
```
Transcripts/
â”œâ”€â”€ database_refresh/     # PDF files from Stage 1 (input)
â”œâ”€â”€ database/            # Master database storage
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ master_database.csv
â”œâ”€â”€ refresh_outputs/     # Processing pipeline outputs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 01_files_to_add.json    # New + modified files to process
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 02_files_to_delete.json # Files to remove from master
â””â”€â”€ logs/               # Error and summary logs
    â”œâ”€â”€ stage1_*.log
    â””â”€â”€ stage2_*.log
```

### Current State
- **Status**: Production ready and fully functional
- **Architecture**: Modular approach with clean separation of concerns
- **Logging**: Comprehensive with execution timing and permanent audit trails
- **Output**: Organized file lists for pipeline processing

## Stage 3+: Database Processing ðŸ”„ PLANNED

### Planned Modular Architecture
Breaking the comprehensive processor into focused, manageable stages:

#### Stage 3: PDF Text Extraction & Bank Identification
- Read files from `refresh_outputs/01_files_to_add.json`
- Extract text with line indexing
- Identify bank names using LLM
- Output: `03_extracted_text.json`, `04_bank_identification.json`

#### Stage 4: Primary Section Classification
- Use LLM to identify 6 main transcript sections
- Output: `05_primary_sections.json`

#### Stage 5: Secondary Section Generation (Chunking)
- Break primary sections into contextual subsections
- These become the searchable chunks
- Output: `06_secondary_sections.json`

#### Stage 6: Enhancement Pipeline
- Generate summaries for all sections
- Create vector embeddings
- Calculate importance and context relevance scores
- Output: `07_enhanced_sections.json`, `08_embeddings.json`

#### Stage 7: Database Update
- Insert processed sections into PostgreSQL
- Update master database with processing status
- Archive completed refresh outputs
- Output: Updated master database

### Database Schema (Designed)
- **Primary table**: `transcript_sections` with full metadata
- **File tracking**: Year, quarter, bank, ticker, file paths
- **Hierarchical structure**: Primary and secondary section types
- **Rich content**: Full text, summaries, token counts
- **Search capabilities**: 2000-dimension embeddings
- **Intelligent reranking**: Importance and context relevance scores

### Key Innovations Planned
1. **Modular pipeline** - each stage focused and testable
2. **Ordered outputs** - clear data flow between stages
3. **No separate chunking step** - secondary sections ARE the chunks
4. **Progressive context building** - each page analyzed with previous context
5. **Smart content handling** - large sections split with overlap to prevent data loss
6. **Comprehensive logging** - consistent across all stages

### Implementation Reference
- **Reference**: `reference/transcript_processor.py` - Comprehensive processor reference for future stages
- **Pattern**: Following Stage 1 and Stage 2 established patterns
- **Dependencies**: pysmb, psycopg2, pgvector, PyPDF2, openai, pandas
- **Configuration**: All settings at top of each script
- **Logging**: Enhanced comprehensive logging with execution timing

## Stage 4: Retrieval System ðŸ“‹ FUTURE

### Planned Architecture
- **Three-path retrieval system** optimized for different query types
- **Query router** that selects optimal retrieval strategy
- **LLM-powered synthesis** for final answer generation
- **Source attribution** with section references

### Retrieval Paths Designed
1. **Similarity Search**: Vector search â†’ LLM filtering â†’ Reranking â†’ Context enhancement
2. **Section Retrieval**: Primary summaries â†’ LLM selection â†’ Full section retrieval
3. **Full Transcript**: Complete document retrieval and synthesis

## Technical Infrastructure

### Current Setup
- **NAS Integration**: Direct SMB connections to wrkgrp30 and wrkgrp33
- **Folder Structure**: Organized separation of inputs, database, outputs, and logs
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension (schema designed)

- **Embeddings**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-large (2000 dimensions)
- **Processing**: Modular pipeline with ordered outputs

### Performance Considerations
- **Memory efficient**: Streaming operations for large files
- **Error resilient**: Individual file failures don't stop pipeline
- **Scalable**: Modular design allows parallel processing
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and statistics across all stages
