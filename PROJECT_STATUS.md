# Bank Transcript Database Project Status

## Project Overview
Creating a comprehensive database system for Canadian and US bank earnings call transcripts with two main stages:

1. **Stage 1**: File aggregation and organization (‚úÖ COMPLETED)
2. **Stage 2**: LLM processing and database creation (üîÑ NEXT)

## Stage 1: File Aggregation - COMPLETED ‚úÖ

### Scope
Automated monitoring and aggregation of bank earnings call transcripts from NAS locations.

### Key Achievements
- ‚úÖ **NAS Connectivity**: NTLM v2 authentication with direct TCP support
- ‚úÖ **Flexible Pattern Matching**: Handles various year-specific naming conventions
  - Quarter folders: Q1, Q121, Q1 2020, Q1 2022 ‚Üí normalized to Q1-Q4
  - Transcript folders: "final transcripts", "clean transcripts", "clean final transcripts"
- ‚úÖ **Smart File Management**: Date-based comparison, deduplication, automatic folder creation
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Continues on failures, creates error logs on NAS
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Logging**: Meaningful progress tracking for users
- ‚úÖ **Standalone Design**: Self-contained script with hardcoded configuration

### Technical Implementation
- **File**: `stage1-file-aggregation/transcript_aggregator.py`
- **Sources**: wrkgrp30 share (Canadian and US peer benchmarking folders)
- **Destination**: wrkgrp33 share (centralized database_refresh folder)
- **Year Range**: 2020-2031
- **File Types**: PDF transcripts only

### Configuration Status
- ‚úÖ Flexible quarter pattern matching implemented
- ‚úÖ Year range updated to 2020+
- ‚úÖ Enhanced transcript folder pattern matching
- ‚úÖ NTLM v2 and direct TCP configured
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **TODO**: Update NAS IP addresses and credentials before production use

## Stage 2: LLM Processing and Database Creation - UPCOMING üîÑ

### Planned Scope
Process aggregated transcript files to create searchable databases using LLM models.

### Planned Components

#### RAG Database
- Vector embeddings of transcript content chunks
- Semantic search capabilities
- Metadata preservation (bank, date, quarter, year, source)
- Integration-ready for chatbot applications

#### Structured Database
- Extract key financial metrics and data points
- Tag content by topics (revenue, guidance, risk factors, etc.)
- Support complex queries and analytics
- Time-series analysis capabilities

#### Processing Pipeline
- PDF text extraction and cleaning
- Content chunking and preprocessing
- LLM-based analysis and tagging
- Database population and indexing
- Quality assurance and validation

### Technical Considerations for Stage 2
- **LLM Integration**: Choose appropriate models for financial text processing
- **Database Technology**: Vector database (e.g., Chroma, Pinecone) + traditional DB
- **Chunking Strategy**: Optimal segment size for financial documents
- **Metadata Schema**: Comprehensive tagging system for financial content
- **Performance**: Batch processing vs. real-time analysis
- **Storage**: Estimated data volumes and storage requirements

## Project Context

### Business Value
- Centralized access to historical and current bank transcript data
- Semantic search across multiple banks and time periods
- Structured financial data extraction and analysis
- Foundation for AI-powered financial research tools

### Data Sources
- **Canadian Banks**: Major Canadian bank earnings calls (RBC, TD, BMO, etc.)
- **US Banks**: Major US bank earnings calls (JPM, BAC, WFC, etc.)
- **Time Range**: 2020 onwards (quarterly transcripts)
- **Volume**: Estimated hundreds of PDF files per year

### Integration Points
- Designed for downstream chatbot integration
- API-ready database structures
- Scalable for additional data sources
- Extensible for other financial document types

## Development Notes

### Lessons Learned from Stage 1
- NTLM v2 and direct TCP required for stable NAS connections
- Flexible pattern matching essential due to inconsistent naming
- BytesIO objects required for pysmb file operations
- Destination path parsing needs careful relative path handling
- Debug logging crucial for troubleshooting connection issues

### Dependencies Confirmed
- `pysmb` for NAS connectivity
- Standard Python libraries (logging, datetime, io, etc.)
- Network access to NAS shares

### Next Session Preparation
- Stage 1 is production-ready after credential configuration
- Begin Stage 2 planning and technology selection
- Consider PDF processing libraries and LLM integration options
- Plan database schema and API design
